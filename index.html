        <h2>It's a me, Mario</h2>
        <p>
            Mario is a fictional character created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. He is the title character of the Mario video game franchise and the mascot of Japanese video game company Nintendo. Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his creation. Depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures generally center on rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser. Mario has access to a variety of power-ups that give him different abilities.

<p>
    Mario first appeared as the player 
    character of Donkey Kong (1981), a platform game.
     Miyamoto wanted to use Popeye as the protagonist, but
      when he could not achieve the licensing rights, 
      he created Mario instead. Miyamoto expected the character
       to be unpopular and planned to use him for cameo appearances; originally called "Mr. Video",
        he was renamed to Mario after Mario Segale. Mario's clothing and characteristics were themed after the setting of Donkey Kong. He then began to star in the Super Mario series of platform games, beginning with the critically acclaimed Super Mario Bros. in 1985. Mario has been voiced by Charles Martinet since 1992, starting with Mario's Game Gallery and later Super Mario 64.
